# e-boxspot

A creation notice of [e-boxspot website](https://e-boxspot.com/).  
This website has been created for my client, who is owner of e-BoxSpot YouTube channel. However for licensing reasons, the source code is not open. But I plan on releasing it as an open source template, which can be used by other channel owners.

## But why bother creating this notice?

Even though I'm not able to release it under an open source license yet, I want to build my portfolio.  
This website consists of three subpages:

- `main`, which displays videos uploaded to YouTube by my client
- `playlists`, which displays YouTube playlists created by my client

- `about`, which displays YouTube channel's description.

All of these subpages use YouTube API in order to display data dynamically.
